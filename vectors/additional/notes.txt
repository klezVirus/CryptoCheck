# HMAC - SHA
As one-way functions, the decrypt part should always be FAIL (or partial-pass, even if unlikely).
The vector with length 0, 00, is interpreted literally by a ZERO from the python script, while it is interpreted as a NULL byte by the AutoTestingTool, for this reason the hashes don't match.

# MonteCarlo - MCT Files
MonteCarlo has not been implemented in this version of the CryptoChecker, so these files were not tested.

# Random Generators
There was no reason to test the PRNG.

# PARTIAL-PASS
The vectors files from NIST applies a length cutting on the final hash/cipher payload.
We didn't applied that restriction in our Python script, so the final hashes/ciphers are sometimes bigger that the ones generated by the tool.
For that reason, PARTIAL-PASS should be considered FULL-PASS.

# Minor errors
If there is a doubt regarding a check, ensure that the plaintexts used were the same (enc), or the ciphertexts (dec).
