# HMAC - SHA
As one-way functions, the decrypt part should always be FAIL (or partial-pass, even if unlikely)
The vector with length 0, 00, is interpreted literally by a ZERO from the python script, while it is interpreted as a NULL byte by the AutoTestingTool, for this reason the hashes don't match

# MonteCarlo - MCT Files
MonteCarlo has not been implemented in this version of the CryptoChecker, so these files were not tested

# Random Generators
There was no reason to test the PRNG

# Minor errors
If there is a doubt regarding a check, ensure that the plaintexts used were the same (enc), or the ciphertexts (dec)
